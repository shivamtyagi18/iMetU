# iMetU

On of the biggest challenges that came up in current COVID-19 pandemic is tracking of who came in contact with whom to predict who can be infected. Social distancing has become a must in such times and thus there is need of an app that can tell us when and where it is safe to be. 

We developed iMetU app to solve this problem to some extent by using location data. The app is very easy to use and does not requires any login.
Use case scenario:

  Larry decides to go for groceries. But he wants to know if the place is crowded.
  
  Larry opens app and put in destination location in search bar.
  
  After map shows the marker with the location searched, Larry presses "Get Neighbours" button. It displays how many people are there in the vicinity of his destination shop. Based on the informationapp suggests if it is OK to go now or not.
  
  Larry searches again and finds it is safe now to go to the shop.

  Larry moves out of his home for groceries.
  
  He starts location sharing by pressing "Start_Sharing_location" button.
  
  When he reaches store, he presses "Get Neighbours" button to know how many people are in his close proximity.
  
  If there are too many people withing close proximity, app alerts Larry to move away from the place.
  
  Larry reaches home and stops location sharing using "Stop_Sharing_Location" button.
  
  USP of our app is that no login is needed to use. App uses device-ids to differentiate between users. We have a Search option, so that user can search a location and can check beforehand before going, how many people are there and what is the average proximity between two people. If the average proximity is less than 500m, app suggests not to go.
